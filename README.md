# Tic Tac Toe in Python

A simple, interactive Tic Tac Toe game that can be played in the command line. This game supports two modes: Player vs. Player and Player vs. AI. The AI uses the Minimax algorithm to make decisions, making it a challenging opponent. The game alternates starting players with each new game for fairness.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need Python 3 installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
